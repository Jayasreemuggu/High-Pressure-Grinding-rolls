Performed molecular dynamics simulations in LAMMPS to calculate intrinsic, extrinsic, and twin stacking fault energies for pure, binary, and ternary Al–Mn–Pd alloys.

Generated 189+ automated simulation inputs using Python scripts across multiple structures and temperatures.

Utilized EAM potentials with minimization, NVT, and NPT ensembles to obtain relaxed structures; applied the DMLF model to compute stacking fault energies.

Analyzed simulation results using OVITO and Python.
